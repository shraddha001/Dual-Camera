**Overview**

TestCamera is an Android application that captures images using both the front and back cameras simultaneously and saves the combined image to the device's storage.

**Features**

**2**. Capture images from both cameras and combine them into a single image.

**3**. Save the combined image to external storage.

**Known Issues**
